# ilUC_Bayesnets

This code was written to support a forthcoming paper (Perkins and Millington, in publication) looking at strategies to mitigate indirect land use change driven by biofuel production.  

The primary analysis libraries used are bnlearn (Scutari 2010) and rstanarm (Goodrich et al., 2018). Other libraries are either for data wrangling, plotting or parallel processing.

The functions script contains functions to learn subcomponent network models, which are then combined together in an overall model.
