# ilUC_Bayesnets

This code was written for a MSc Dissertation research project, using Bayesian Network analysis to study USA agricultural land use change 1990-2017.

The primary analysis libraries used are bnlearn (Scutari 2010) and rstanarm (Goodrich et al., 2018). Other libraries are either for data wrangling, plotting or parallel processing.

The functions script contains functions to learn subcomponent network models, which are then combined together in an overall model.
